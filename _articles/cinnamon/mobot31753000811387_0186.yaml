label: "Cinnamon bark, in Carolus Clusius, Exoticorum Libri Decem ([Leiden]: Ex Officin\xE2 Plantinian\xE2 Raphelengii 1605) 171."
summary: "Clusius adapted Orta\u2019s work once more for this publication on exotic naturalia. Unhappy with the leaf image from his 1567 edition of Orta\u2019s work, he left it out here, and only included the image of cinnamon bark."
