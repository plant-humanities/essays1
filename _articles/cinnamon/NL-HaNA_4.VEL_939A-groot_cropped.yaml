summary: 'The image on the left shows a demarcated area of forest to be cultivated; the image in the middle shows the same field after the original vegetation was cleared; and the image on the right shows the chena as a monoculture of cinnamon. The text at the bottom is a calculation of the expected returns. A field with only five cinnamon trees could contain 135 trees after cultivation: a 27-fold increase. When this image was produced, however, the VOC was still very reluctant to abandon the wild harvest approach it had always adopted, and chena practices were dicouraged.'
